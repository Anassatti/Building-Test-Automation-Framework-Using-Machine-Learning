# Building-Test-Automation-Framework-Using-Machine-Learning
In this repo I will build test automation framework using machine learning in the error detection and prediction. By using ML the framework will be able to recover from the issue will face during execution process.
Proof of concept of building automation framework will look like below:

***Work Plan***

**I will follow below strategies in building this framework**

1. Building Separate Machine Learning Solution for image process 
2. Improve ML solution to detect the differences in UI, means comparing two images and detecting what the changes happen 
3. Building Test Automation framework
4. Integrate ML solution and the Automation framework
